# HomeRunDVR
This program is not very polished right now.  It is quick and dirty application for you to be able to specify a schedule for recording videos from the HD HomeRun cable box.

You can check the issues to get an idea of things that I plan to do in the future with this application.

Compiling:

This can be compiled easily by running: ./gradlew build

Once compiled you can get details about the command line arguments by running: java -cp build/libs/HomeRunDVR.jar com.jentfoo.recorder.HomeRunStreamDVR

File issues if you have questions, or suggestions for future improvement
